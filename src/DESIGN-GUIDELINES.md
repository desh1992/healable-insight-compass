# Design System Guidelines

This document outlines the core design principles and guidelines for our application. These principles should inform all design and development decisions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Prioritize Invisible Design
- Strive for seamless and intuitive user experiences
- Design should feel natural and unobtrusive
- Minimize user friction through thoughtful interaction design
- Users should accomplish tasks without noticing the interface

### 2. Implement Design Thinking
- Base all design decisions on a deep understanding of user needs
- Consider user emotions and potential points of confusion or delight
- Empathy is paramount in all design decisions
- Gather user feedback and iterate based on observations

### 3. Form Follows Function
- Functionality must guide the design's form
- Prioritize simplicity, clarity, and effectiveness
- Balance functional requirements with aesthetics
- Eliminate unnecessary decorative elements that don't serve a purpose

### 4. Learn from Observation
- Analyze successful designs to identify effective patterns
- Study structural choices, color use, spacing, and emotional impact
- Adapt and innovate based on these findings
- Continuously evaluate and improve through user testing

### 5. Leverage Constraints for Creativity
- Embrace minimalism and purposeful restraint
- Use limitations as opportunities to drive focused solutions
- Constraints lead to more creative and impactful designs
- Do more with less; simplify where possible

### 6. Design with Intention
- Ensure every design element serves a clear purpose
- All decisions should align with the overall goals
- Nothing should be arbitrary; everything should be deliberate
- Question the purpose of each element in the interface

### 7. Uphold Human-Centered Principles
- Create designs that are holistic and sustainable
- Design with empathy at the core
- Make accessibility a priority, not an afterthought
- Consider diverse user needs and contexts

## Practical Application

### Component Structure
Components should:
- Have clearly defined responsibilities
- Be composable and reusable
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Be well-documented with usage examples

### Visual Style
- Use the defined color palette consistently (see `src/lib/theme.ts`)
- Apply spacing according to the spacing scale
- Maintain typography hierarchy for readability
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

### Interaction Design
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Use motion purposefully to guide attention
- Ensure all interactive elements are easily identifiable
- Design for different input methods (mouse, keyboard, touch)

### Code Implementation
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement responsive designs that work across devices
- Follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Optimize performance for all users

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Beginning a new component or feature:**
   - Review these principles before starting design or development
   - Consider how each principle applies to your specific task
   - Use the `evaluateDesignDecision()` function from `src/lib/designSystem.ts` to check alignment

2. **Code reviews:**
   - Reference specific design principles in your review comments
   - Ensure new code adheres to the established guidelines
   - Consider the holistic user experience, not just technical implementation

3. **Design reviews:**
   - Use these principles as evaluation criteria
   - Question design decisions that don't align with these guidelines
   - Suggest alternatives that better fulfill our design philosophy
